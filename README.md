# rebelsky-cv

This repository contains Samuel A. Rebelsky's curriculum vitae and some
other related files.

I will admit that the work does not quite meet my standards.  I had planned
to use LaTeX elegantly.  But at some point, "get it done" beat "get it done
well".  If I'd been using LaTeX since my CV started (twenty plus years ago),
it would probably be better.  But for some reason, I moved from a LaTeX
CV at Chicago and Dartmouth to an HTML CV at Grinnell, and moving back to
LaTeX required more effort than I had planned.

Maybe it will get better over time :-).

## Notes

Make sure to make a fonts directory and then copy fonts from Awesome-CV 
and SourceSansPro into that directory. (At least on the Mac.) On the
Mac, you may also need to installthe fonts into FontBook.
